## Reverse Image Search
- Can use google images, yandex and tineye for reverse image search. 
- Yandex looks for similar photos (can be important).
- Google and Tineye finds articles/sites where image used. (Google does the best job but use tineye too).

## Viewing EXIF data
- Information about time, location, phone etc.
- Jeffrey's exif viewer (not available last I checked) 
- Can use linux tools too
